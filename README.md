## Preeti Input

A simple way to allow users to use preeti font for input purpose.
```
The idea is very simple:
1. Load local preety font if available. If local font is not available, download and load the preeti font from server.
2. Set the font-family of desired input(s) to `Preeti`
3. Use the same font-family when displaying the data
```
### Note

> I, seriously, have no idea if this is the best approach. This is the only approach I could think of. If you have a better approach, please do suggest or create a PR.
